analyse the full project.here some error:
-there are no frontend page to handle password rest link.the password reset link is given below but there are no page to handle it.firtsly analyse the sql codes and full project structure and then modify the codebase as needed for implementing these features and also you can modify or create database scheme.the password reset link from supabase is below> https://vbpepgysyzrllyegzety.supabase.co/auth/v1/verify?token=423236f8ff92dd7c6a262ff64e6c167a0f4390efd10a3818e8be1aef&type=recovery&redirect_to=https://techspecdev.vercel.app/reset-password i have made this link from supabase setting but my webpage is not capabole to handle it.
-i want to show details of a product in a generated link instead of popup so that it can be shareable to other.you can change the stack of running web technology if it is not possible to handle forot url or show details in another page .
-i dont know it is supabase functional error or frontend retrieve problem but my page cannot show the total visitor 
-there are no popup closer button in resister page or it is behind the display because it overflowed in the display so also solve this issue.
-the filter functionality also need to modify .now it send requesto to the server when anything changed in search bar so user cannot set min price max price because it redirect instantly after a tiny changes.and the filter functionality becomes unvisile when i filters anything so user also no have choice to modify their search without exiting running filter that is boring.
- i just have pointed some UI UX issue that i can see as you are an ai so you can analye the ui ux better than me so modify as it.
- i want to use this application in production for reveniue generation so SEO is  also an important think. 
lets analyse the full project(frontend and database) and then start coding where needed.as the existing structure
